# TunePulse
### Work in progress
TunePulse is a place where you can check out your Spotify listening stats without it keeping any of your personal info. It's an open source project. I'm open to any suggestions you might have, your input is crucial in making TunePulse better.

### Update: Project stable and revived. Currently aiming to release V2 in March.
