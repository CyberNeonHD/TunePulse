# TunePulse
### Work in progress
TunePulse is a place where you can check out your Spotify listening stats without it keeping any of your personal info. It's an open source project that I'm working on. It is still in progress, and I'm excited to share the journey with you. For more details about what's coming up, take a look at our roadmap. This is my first big project, and I'm putting my heart into making the design and features top-notch. I'm open to any suggestions you might have, your input is crucial in making TunePulse better.
